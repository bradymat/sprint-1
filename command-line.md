With the command line you can access anything from your computer or the web if you know how to get there. Takes a bit of time getting used to it and it's almost like learning a different language, but it is very powerful.

1. pwd showes you what folders you are inside
2. cd returns you to the start of the folders on your currently logged in user
3. cd ****** lets you go to a certain place in your computer
4. mkdir makes a new folder where you CURRENTLY are (use pwd to check where you are if unsure)
5. touch file can be used to create or change a file
